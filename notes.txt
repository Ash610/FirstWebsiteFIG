THURSDAY:
1) index.html between lines 85 and 95 
2) "Contact Us" div tags open on line 21 and 22 are not closed? also, indentation.
3) what is in OldFig.html?
4) All files need formatting attention. INDENTATION IS IMPORTANT. close tags right away then put stuff in there.
5) Please avoid having spaces in file names. Use camelCase or underscores instead.

<div>
    <p>
        
    </p>
</div>

FRIDAY:
1) I'm still seeing sloppy indentation -> this leads to problems with unclosed or not-matching tags
2) for most of your pages -> img tag has height/width attributes, but also has column classes --> both of these things will attempt to control its appearance. which one gets priority?
3) Please consider the files you're including and the order that they are loaded in.
