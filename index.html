          The Finance and Investment Group was founded in the Fall Semester of 2009 when the Collegiate Finance Organization and Investment Society merged together. The mission of Finance &amp; Investment Group is to present dedicated finance students with career opportunities in the field of finance and to introduce them to professionals in the business community.  FIG also wants to increase their awareness of financial markets by providing students with valuable information, either through workshops or our Stock game competition.We have stayed true to our mission for the past 6 years and grown into the largest student organization in the College of Business.

            <p class="justified">
              <strong>What  is  Portfolio Management  Team (PMT)? </strong>
              PMT is  a student-run investment  team  that  will  actively  manage  capital in  an  effort  outperform  certain 
              market  benchmarks. It  was created in  an  effort  to  further advance the practical knowledge of  UIC 
              Business  students  through analyzing and investing in  financial markets.  PMT seeks to  educate students  
              through the creation  and management  of  a student fund  that  will  progress  the individual  and school  as  
              employers undoubtedly seek  out more  practical talent  in  finance.
            </p>
            <p class="justified">
              <strong>Who can join?</strong>
              Anyone  with  a finance,  accounting, or  IDS major is  strongly  encouraged  to  join  as  this  opportunity will advance themselves  professionally  as  well  as  their own university. However,  PMT is  looking for 
              candidates  that  not only  exhibit current interest  and experience  in  investing but also  possess the passion 
              for learning  and advancement that  will  keep  them  engaged in  developing  the fund  and its holdings.
            </p>
            <p class="justified">
              <strong>What  is  the time  commitment? How often do  we  meet  and what  days?</strong>
              Members can expect  to  spend three hours a week  with  PMT.  One hour  of  this  will  be  spent in  our weekly  
              meetings  Wednesday evenings, in  which sectors present their weekly  stock picks.  The other two hours 
              will  be  spent preparing for weekly  all-member  meetings. Members will  be  expected  to  spend one of  these 
              two hours with  their sectors preparing presentations and selecting sector  picks and another hour  spent 
              on  individual  research. This  three hour  time  commitment  is  a MINIMUM expectation.  Sector  leaders may 
              mandate that  more  time  is  needed  individually  each  week, and quality work  is  expected  from  each  
              analyst and not just  portfolio leadership.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="column large-6 medium-6">
            <p class="justified">
              <strong>How is  it  organized?</strong>
              PMT will  invest  in  five  different sectors:  Technology, Consumer  Goods (Industrial,  Durable,  NonDurable),
              Healthcare, Financial Services, and Energy  (including  Alternative,  Oil,  Gas,  and Wind).  Each  
              sector  will  have  a dedicated team  led by  a sector  manager and core  analysts. Each  week, sectors will  be  
              responsible for proposing one investment  idea. It  must  be well researched  and the presentation  will  
              provide measures  for entering  and exiting all trades  complete  with  risk  levels  and portfolio benchmark 
              weights and returns.
              A portfolio manager will  be  head  of  the group.  They  will  take  weekly  investment  proposals to  the Finance 
              and Investments group’s advisor for final investment  approval. They  will  call  on  votes for proposals and 
              determines  the final recommendations of  the group.  They  can also  indicate  companies of  interest  that  
              will  lead  the group’s strategy. This  person  will  be  responsible for the group’s success and must  
              communicate effectively both  to  administration  and students. They  should  be  quick to  identify  areas   of  
              project management  and team  dynamics  that  need  improvement and be  proactive about resolving those.
              Three portfolio analysts  will  also  manage  all sector  report  and performance,  helping determine weights 
              of  sectors prior to  investing and keeping track of  risk  measures. This  is  a job made  for highly  analytical  
              people  comfortable with  keeping track of  many  numbers and interested  in  managerial  reporting.
